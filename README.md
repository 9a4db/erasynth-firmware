# ERASynth

ERASynth uses Arduino Due to run the device. Also there is ESP8266 connected to Arduino with serial connection. It is the base of interface. With ESP8266, ERASynth has become platform-independent project. You only need to have web-browser to control your device.ERASynth basicly runs a Arduino code. So anyone who is interested in Arduino can develop own his code and make ERA Synth better.

## Install

You only need the Arduino IDE to compile and upload. We have three part of code.

* Arduino DUE
* ESP8266
* ESP8266 HTML Data


To compile ESP code you need to update Arduino IDE board manager. You can find instructions at following link: https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino

For detailed instructions, please go to our web site and you can find user guide.
